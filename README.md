## TODO

- [ ] add content (text and figures) from the pages that were missing from the source PDF
- [ ] improve the quality of the figures (either by upsampling the scanned diagrams, or by re-drawing them from scratch, using something like https://github.com/anandthakker/euclid; in the latter case, the declarative drawing instructions could be put in the text file directly, contained in an ‘euclid’ code block or alike; cfr https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14058707)
